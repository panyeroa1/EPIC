## Objective(s)
1. Pivot UI to "Apple App Aesthetic" with Roboto typography.
2. Maintain Black, White, Lime Green palette with softer Control Center-style elements.
3. Enhance mobile and desktop tactile feedback (rounded elements, squircle cards).

## Scope Boundaries
- Font: Roboto (Full weight set).
- Shapes: Highly rounded corners (rounded-2xl to rounded-3xl).
- Visuals: Glassmorphism, subtle ios-shadows, generous padding.

## Files Updated
- `index.html`: Imported Roboto, updated Tailwind config with squircle radius.
- `App.tsx`: Refined sidebar navigation and layout for Apple look.
- `Intelligence.tsx`: Softer card interactions and Roboto-based hierarchy.
- `ApexView.tsx`: Governance dashboard refinement.
- `SpacesView.tsx`: Telemetry visualization update.

## Verification
- PASS: Roboto applied across all text nodes with correct weights.
- PASS: UI elements feel tactile and modern, matching "Apple App" expectations.
- PASS: Lime green accent remains high-impact but visually integrated.
